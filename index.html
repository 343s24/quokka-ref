    <h1>Quokkas</h1>
    <p>
      An estimated 4,000 quokkas occur on the mainland, with nearly all mainland populations being groups of fewer than 50,
      although one declining group of over 700 occurs in the southern forest between Nannup and Denmark.

        The quokka (/'kwɒkə/)
        (Setonix brachyurus), the only member of the genus Setonix, is a small macropod about the size of a domestic cat.

      In 2007, the quokka population on Rottnest Island was estimated at between 8,000 and 12,000. Snakes are the quokka's
      only predator on the island. The population on smaller Bald Island, where the quokka has no predators, is 600-1,000.
      At
      the end of summer and into autumn, a seasonal decline of quokkas occurs on Rottnest Island, where loss of vegetation
      and
      reduction of available surface water can lead to starvation.

      Quokkas can also be observed at several zoos and wildlife parks around Australia, including Perth Zoo. Physical
      interaction is generally not permitted without explicit permission from supervising staff.

        Quokkas additionally must
        give consent.

      Quokka behavior in response to human interaction has been examined in zoo environments. One brief study indicated
      fewer
      animals remained visible from the visitor paths when the enclosure was an open or walk-through environment. This may
      have been due to the quokkas acquiring avoidance behavior of visitors, which the authors propose has implications for
      stress management in their exhibition to the public.

        In other words, they are quokkward.
